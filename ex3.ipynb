    "\n",
    "Errors occur when some spurious operation acts on our qubits. Their effects cause things to go wrong in our circuits. The strange results you may have seen when running on real devices is all due to these errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can pretend that there are only two types of error: bit flips and phase flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bit flips have the same effect as the `x` gate. They flip the $|0\\rangle$ state of a single qubit to $|1\\rangle$ and vice-versa. Phase flips have the same effect as the `z` gate, introducing a phase of $-1$ into superpositions. Put simply, they flip the $|+\\rangle$ state of a single qubit to $|-\\rangle$ and vice-versa."

The artificial errors are inserted as `x` and `z` gates on two particular qubits (error_qubits).\n",
